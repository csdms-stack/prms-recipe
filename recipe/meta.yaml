  summary: The USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System
  description: |
    The Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) is a
    deterministic, distributed-parameter, physical process based
    modeling system developed to evaluate the response of various
    combinations of climate and land use on streamflow and general
    watershed hydrology.
